  SnowBidPro is my first SAAS that helps snow contractors by automating the onboarding process of new customers and automates communication via SMS based on snow forecasts with AI. 
  The system was designed to support solor operators who don't want full complex CRM systems but an easy to use alternative.
  The idea was to automate and systemize this process to help contractors or solor operators focus on what they do best. 
  Allowing AI to handle customer relations.

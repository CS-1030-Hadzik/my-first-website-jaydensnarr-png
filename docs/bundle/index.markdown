# Introduction

I am a builder, strategist, and analysist. By heart I'm a born entrepreneur, I love creating systems that have high percieved value in the marketplace. I practice business on the side and while in school I implement new ideas that I learn in school, into my current businesses to optimize performance. One system is called SnowBidPro. SnowBidPro is a Simplified CRM for solo operators who want to take back the time they spend generating quote for potential customers. I've automated that process with a customer self-serviced bidding and accepting process. I use AI automated sms notifications to notify current clients about upcoming services based on forecasts from near-by Weather services. By so doing, SnowBidPro helps automated customer relations, provides operators with summarized conversations between Client and AI via SMS, provides real time notifications on accepted bids based on the operators desired bid amount all from an easy to use dashboard. With a click of a button operators will send simple forms to their customers, customers can share that form. The operator stays in complete control wihtout the need to learning complex CRMs like Jobber. 

## Important to Know about me

> When it comes to learning, I tend to lose interest early on or with small principles until it is entirely applicable to what I'm wanting to learn.
> When it comes to financial independance. I see most industries as opportunities. Through out my educational career I hope to learn to effectively analyse my thoughts and narrow my focus to what can be done realistically given my living situation at any given time. 
> When I think of both self-awareness and mindfullness. It is important to me that I live by this quote, "For every problem under the sun, there is either a solution or there is none. If there is? Find it. If there isn't? Nevermind it." I like this quote because it involves taking action to solve problems and when there is no solution, having the confidence to step away for a time.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
